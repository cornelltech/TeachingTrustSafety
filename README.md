The Trust & Safety Teaching Consortium
=======================================

The Trust & Safety Teaching Consortium (TSTC) is a coalition of academic, industry and non-profit experts launched in 2023. Trust & Safety is an emerging field that focuses on reducing the harm from interpersonal abuse in digital spaces. Our goal is to create and share educational material that can be used to teach a variety of audiences about trust and safety issues in a wide variety of formats.

Please find below a curriculum composed of 13 slide decks with associated readings, cases, and exercises. These can be freely reused, with credit. 

The teaching content we created covers sensitive topics, and instructors should carefully review materials before assigning them. Instructors should consider what content warnings they want to apply and what content might not be appropriate for their audience.

Membership
-----------

We actively welcome contributions. Digital safety educators and professionals can join the Trust & Safety Teaching Consortium as a member or an affiliate.

Members have taught or prepared material for at least one 60-minute T&S class in higher education or industry in the past five years or have concrete plans to do so in the next 12 months. Members are expected to contribute to at least one module in the TSTC curriculum a year. Members can join quarterly virtual meetings of the TSTC and be elected to the TSTC Steering Committee. Members get full access to any gated material and can engage with each other through our dedicated Google Group.

TSTC Members are coordinated by a steering committee currently composed of [Alex Stamos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexstamos), [Alexios Mantzarlis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mantzarlis), [Laura McLester](https://www.linkedin.com/in/laura-m-a0667022/), and [Marten Risius](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martenrisius/). We are grateful to all contributors and in particular to Shelby Grossman for her work getting TSTC started.

Affiliates are more loosely interested in Trust & Safety teaching and would like to receive updates from the TSTC / potentially become a member down the road. Affiliates must either be instructors in a higher education setting, be employed in a T&S role across industry or civil society, or have previously been employed in a T&S role for at least 4 years.

To apply to join the TSTC as either a member or an affiliate, [please fill this form](https://forms.gle/qec1MtnZE6sRZbKc6). For any questions about the consortium or to let us know about how you used the curriculum, please email am3368@cornell.edu and trustandsafetyjournal@stanford.edu.
