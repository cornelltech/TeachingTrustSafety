\section{Introduction}

\begin{frame}{Learning objectives}
	Today we will:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Learn about the purpose and history of trust \& safety
		\item Learn about approaches to trust \& safety
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Purpose and history of trust \& safety}


\begin{frame}{What drives trust \& safety?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Corporate responsibility
		\item Crisis sensitivity (cf. Zoom paper)
		\item Regulation, regulatory pressure (from Europe's DSA to the Australian Safety by Design framework)
		\item Upstream technological standards applied through the stack (see, e.g., Apple’s app rules)
		      \note[item]{"Trust and safety is the study of how people abuse the internet to cause real human harm, often using [online] products the way they are designed to work" (Journal of Online Trust \& Safety).}
		      \note[item] {Trust and Safety is also a practice and a field within technology companies that is concerned with the reduction, prevention, and mitigation of online harms. Per the Trust \& Safety Professional Association: "As internet communities, online services, and the use of digital technologies to mediate our  daily lives and interactions have continued to grow, technology companies have needed to determine the kinds of content and behaviors that are appropriate and those that are not. The teams that handle this responsibility often fall under the general term 'trust and safety.'" Source: App store review guidelines, \url{https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/}}

\begin{frame}{History and evaluation of T\&S field}
	\footnotesize
	Origins
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Ebay: prominent early user of term "trust \& safety"
	\end{itemize}
	Where T\&S "grew" from:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Operations (ex. eBay: from Customer Service)
		\item Legal (ex. "Origins of Trust \& Safety" Databite podcast with Alexander MacGilivray and Nicole Wong)
		\item Information Security, Cybersecurity (ex: Alex Stamos "Battle for the Soul of the Internet" lecture)
	\end{itemize}
	Expanding scope of T\&S
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Today, Trust \& Safety teams across industry have different scopes, missions and organizational structures: the field continues to evolve.
	\end{itemize}
	As an academic topic, T\&S  shares borders with:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Internet governance, cybersecurity, Internet Policy,  Internet freedom, platform governance, but also online terrorism and violent extremism, disinformation, hate speech, online forensics, etc.
	\end{itemize}
